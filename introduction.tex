Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB) is a fully student-run organization founded in 2016 with the goal of developing rocket technologies and achieving spaceflight. Since then, the team has extensively developed its \textit{Low-Altitude Demonstrator} (LAD) program in order to flight-test critical infrastructure and fine-tune its design and in-house manufacturing processes. Each LAD flight in the team’s history has served the purpose of validating important components and designs to be used on future rockets, and an accelerated design cycle allows for rapid empirical testing. In 2019, the team debuted its EUREKA space-shot program; the propulsion system of EUREKA-1, the team’s first liquid-fuel rocket, is currently under development. To flight-test and validate the avionics and recovery system that will fly aboard EUREKA-1 and successive vehicles, LAD-4 was built within a seven-week span in the spring semester of 2020. Beyond its primary use as a test vehicle, LAD-4 was an educational project that allowed newer members to develop skills in the basics of rocket design, experience composite material manufacturing, and taste the sweetness of flight. LAD-4 was also designed to break university records for altitude and speed, and to be the first supersonic vehicle built by a student team at the University of California, Berkeley.
